                <p class="bodytext">    My name is Shawn and I love my family, coding, and making music. 
                I have been married to my wife Kalli for nearly 12 years and we have 3 wonderful kids: Porter, Olivia, and Foss.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="bodytext">    I began my coding adventure a year ago as I started to explore Java development. I felt like I was not synthesizing the information I was learning into anything cohesive, so I started a course in web development offered through the University of Utah.
                I have been able to learn at an accelerated rate with the help of amazing instructors and peers.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="bodytext">    I have been making music for over 20 years and I am currently the senior tubist in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/23rdarmyband/" target="_blank">23rd Army Band</a> and perform regularly with the <a href="http://www.utahwindsymphony.org/" target="_blank">Utah Wind Symphony</a> on the euphonium.</p>
